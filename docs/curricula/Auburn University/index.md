## institutional mission
As a land-grant institution, AU is dedicated to improving the lives of the people of Alabama, the nation, and the world through forward-thinking education, life-enhancing research and scholarship, and selfless service.
## culture, curriculum, or strategic plans
Many programs have aimed to increase awareness about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education for 
female students across the globe, such as the Cybergirlz and Cyberhigh initiatives [1]. In our efforts to attract 
underrepresented female students towards future careers in Computer Science (CS) and Music, we developed the MAGIC + M 
program - a curriculum combining music, CS, and robotics.  In the context of this project, we believe that Perfomatics [2] 
is a potential area which may attract students to CS. The main steps of the curriculum are: (1) Introducing students to CS 
concepts and skills using Scratch music-related games [3] Introducing students to music-based story telling. 
(2) Teaching basics of music programming using EarSketch, figure 1 [4].  
(3) Introducing social robots and the features of semi- humanoid PEPPER robot shown in figure 2 [5]. 
(4) Teaching how to synchronize their social PEPPER robot with their musical composition.
(5) Providing an opportunity for student presentations in a dancing robot competition.
